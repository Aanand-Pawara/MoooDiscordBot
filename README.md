# MNDRiN Discord Bot

A modular, well-structured Discord bot developed specifically for the **MNDRiN Server**.  
This bot provides hybrid command support, styled interactions, and real-time responsiveness. It is deployed on **Render** and maintained using **UptimeRobot** for continuous uptime.

## Deployment

### Hosting Platform: [Render](https://render.com/)

- The bot is deployed as a **background worker** service or a **web service** with a lightweight Flask server to allow pings.
- Code is automatically pulled from GitHub and deployed via Render‚Äôs CI/CD system.
- Environment variables are managed securely within the Render dashboard.

### Keep-Alive Strategy: [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/)

- A minimal Flask web server runs alongside the bot, exposing a root (`/`) endpoint.
- UptimeRobot pings this endpoint every 5 minutes to prevent Render from idling, ensuring near 24/7 availability.
